            . I have a keen interest in software engineering and cloud
            solutions.

            I truly believe that cloud computing has lowered the
            barrier-to-entry for any developer worldwide to ship their software
            at any scale and budget. I have 2+ years of experience working on
            Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform; designing and
            managing production cloud deployments for a varied list of
            customers, where I have performed DevOps automations, written
            scalable & maintainable IaC, worked with popular tools like Docker,
            Kubernetes, Terraform, etc and witnessed the power of cloud
            first-hand.

            I enjoy learning and figuring things out by tinkering with them. I
            am a certified AWS Solutions Architect Associate, GCP Associate
            Cloud Engineer and Hashicorp Certified: Terraform Associate. I am
            currently working on becoming a Certified Kubernetes Application
            Developer to solidify my Kubernetes foundation.

            I was born in the diamond city of Surat and grew up in the
            industrial town of Vapi. I achieved my Bachelor's degree in Computer
            Science from Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal where I met
            some wonderful people and lifelong friends. I graduated in 2020 (a
            couple months into COVID lockdowns; it was a unique experience to
            say the least). I love working out, running, listening to music, and
            going on unplanned road-trips.{' '}
