            I truly believe that cloud computing has lowered the
            barrier-to-entry for any developer worldwide to ship their software
            at any scale and budget. To gain more exposure to how the cloud

            I was born and brought up in the diamond city of Surat, India. I
            moved to Manipal in 2016 to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer
            Science where I met some wonderful friends. I graduated in 2020 and
            have been working as a Platform Engineer since. I love working out,
