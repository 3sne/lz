# Landing Zone

This repo contains the source for [mukur.dev](https://mukur.dev/), intended to be my little corner on the web. I am working on customizing a static Next.js (and learning along the way) site based on Lee Robinson's portfolio website [leerob.io](https://leerob.io/) as the codebase (Thanks Lee!). The `coming-soon` has been set as the main branch until the customization is completed on the `main` branchâ€”which will then be promoted to production.

I liked the simplicity of Lee's website and I plan to use the same design language to showcase my journey in tech.
