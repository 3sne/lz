I joined Vercel as employee #34. We're grown a lot from Series A and today we announced our $150M Series D at a $2.5B valuation. I took some time to write about working at a hypergrowth company and reflected on my [past year and a half at Vercel](/blog/hypergrowth).

## Updates

- I wrote a post [Rust Is the Future of JavaScript Infrastructure](/blog/rust), which now has over 80,000 views and hit #1 on Hacker News.
- I recorded a new video [Should you learn JavaScript before React?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbbiVmFK910)
- I recorded a [code walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZZFW5xDjJ4) for [leerob.io](http://leerob.io/) (Next.js / Tailwind / Prisma / PlanetScale).

## Next.js Conf

[Next.js 12 was released at Next.js Conf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRQ5z7i7pxE). There's so much from Next.js Conf I'm excited about, but I'll share a few highlights I was involved with:

- Talking with Kelsey Hightower about the future of the Edge
- Showing a demo of React Server Components with Next.js
- Showing a demo of the new Rust Compiler and URL Imports

In case you missed it, all of the conference talks [are on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBnKlKpPeagnJYpc5geAHU40ld5hk8i82).
